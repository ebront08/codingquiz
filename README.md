I have added 4 commits. Changes to the script.js , and index.html. I have also tried to figure out why the github pages is loading without the javascript. I checked the console and I see that it says "failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 not found". However, on the local it loads fine. And starts the counter and when clicking on start I am presented with a question. So I have attached a screenshot.
